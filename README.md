# S-MVC
**A simple and customizable PHP MVC framwork**
### Usage
To start a website you only need to create some files in *App* directory and change config file in *Config* directory. You can also put your css, js in *Public* directory.

##### URLs :
URLs are built with this pattern : *yoursite.com/controller/method/param1/param2/param3* ...
  
e.g : *yoursite.com/post/listen/12* will create a *post* controller object and call *listen* method with an argument : *12*

##### Creating a new page :
To create a new page go to the *App/Controller* directory and create a new file called *nameController.php* where *name* is the name of your controller.

The basic structure for a controller is :
```php
<?php
	namespace App\Controller;

	class nameController extends appController{

		public function index(){
			echo('You are on the name Controller, calling the index method. Well Done!');
		}

	}
```
Then if you go to *yoursite.com/name/* this message will appear!

##### Passing parameters :
In your methods you can specify the parameters you want :
```php
<?php
	namespace App\Controller;

	class nameController extends appController{

		public function index($param = null){
			$param = is_null($param) ? '' : $param;
			echo('You are on the name Controller, calling the index method. Well Done! Param : ' . $param);
		}

	}
```
**Put all your arguments with a default value because user can go to an url without passing parameters in this one!!!**

##### Rendering a view (with parameters) :
Quiet simple!

Create a file in *App/View*. E.g :
```php
<h1>Index view</h1>
<p>Today the message is : <?= $message ?></p>
```
In your controller :
```php
<?php
	namespace App\Controller;

	class nameController extends appController{

		public function index(){
			//Same variable name as in the view file
			$message = 'You are on the name Controller, calling the index method. Well Done!';
		
			//See documentation for compact function ;)
			$this->render('index', compact('message'));
		}

	}
```

##### Using models :
Models file are in *App/Model* and must be called with *Model* at the end. E.g : *postModel.php*

The basic model structure is :
```php
<?php
	namespace App\Model;

	class nameModel{

		//Just a function for exemple purposes, create your own. Models are the part of website that retrieve data
		public function get(){
			return 'I am fine!!!!!!!';
		}

	}
```

For exemple, this model is called *nameModel.php*

Now, in your controller you can load models with *loadModel* method :
```php
<?php
	namespace App\Controller;

	class nameController extends appController{

		public function index(){
			// Will create $this->name variable automatically
			$this->loadModel('name');
			
			//Same variable name as in the view file
			$message = $this->name->get();
		
			//See documentation for compact function ;)
			$this->render('index', compact('message'));
		}

	}
```

Easy right?

##### Adding an html template :
Just modify the *default.php* file in *App/View/Template* and make your own template! Put the content with this line of code :
```php
<div id="content">
	<!-- Content generated by the framework wich add the view file into the div, don't worry ;) -->
	<?= $content ?>
</div>
```

##### Adding librairies :
**With composer :**
Edit the *composer.json* file adding your dependecies, the autoloader is loaded in *App/app.php* file so you can directly use the dependencies. Read more about composer at : https://getcomposer.org/
**Without composer :**
Go in the *Lib/* folder and put all external librairies (like my form class : https://github.com/hugopb82/form).
**Delete all namespaces in those files and be sure that the filename is the same as the class name.**
Now you can load the librairy without requiring it, just do: 
```php
$class = new Class();
```
E.g. with my form class in a view file, I put *form.php* in *Lib/* :
```php
	$form = new form('index.php');
	$form->add('textbox', 'title');
	echo $form->end();
```

##### Getting config params :
If you go to the *Config/Config.php* file, you'll see a multidimensionnal array.
For exemple : 
```php
	array(
		"Database" => array(
			"host" => "localhost",
			"username" => "root"
		)
	);
```
You can get those parameters in any file (Model, View or Controller) using :
```php
Config::get($prefix, $key);
// For e.g. : Config::get('Database', 'host');
```
